# Marvel Challange

This is a technical challenge for a selection process for junior iOS developer.

## Challange Description

Create a mobile application using [**Marvel's public API**](https://developer.marvel.com)

The application should list the Marvel characters on a screen with
infinite scroll and detail each character on another screen (it's not
use all information provided in the API).

### Architecture

In this project I used VIP.

This architecture was born with the intention of taking the weight of ViewControllers and increasing the testability of the code. Each screen is considered a scene which is formed by six components: ViewController, Presenter, Interactor, Worker, Models and Router. The connection between all these components is made using protocols.
